Sometimes you want to fill, sometimes you want to indent.  This package tries
to figure out which you want and does that one.

I'd recommend binding =M-q= to =filldent-dwim= and it should â€¦ /just work/.

You can also tell =filldent= to decide whether to fill or indent based on mode,
with =filldent-fill-modes= and =filldent-indent-modes=.  Uh, and you can set the
default using =filldent-default=.

* Installing

*filldent* is now on [[https://melpa.org/#/filldent][MELPA]]!  So you can install it using a properly-configured
=package.el= or whatever other way you prefer.
