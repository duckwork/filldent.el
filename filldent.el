;;; Commentary:

;; From a conversation in #emacs, where someone was confused about M-q vs.
;; C-M-\.  I realized that we rarely want to indent prose, or fill programming,
;; so let's do a dwim-style thing.  That's filldent.

;; Apparently `paredit' already has a binding like this, set to M-q.  Very
;; interesting.

This option only takes effect when calling `filldent-paragraph',

When t, if the point is on a comment or string in an `indent'
mode, instead of indenting the current defun, fill the current
paragraph.  When nil, indent the current defun.

This defaults to t to fulfill the principle of least-surprise, at
